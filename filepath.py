# Typing Modules Used:
# In the code above, the typing module is used to provide type hints. Specifically, the following types from the typing module are used:

# List: To indicate that the function returns a list of dictionaries.
# Dict: To specify that the dictionaries in the list have string keys and values of any type.
# Any: To indicate that the values within the dictionaries can be of any type.

# Possible Error in the Variable FILEPATH:
# The variable FILEPATH in the code snippet is expected to be a string representing the file path of the JSON file to be read. There are a few possible errors related to this variable:

# If FILEPATH is not a string, you might encounter a type-related error. The code expects it to be a string.
# If FILEPATH is a relative path, the file may not be found if the working directory is different when the code is executed. Using an absolute path or handling the file path dynamically based on your project structure can mitigate this issue.
# If the file specified by FILEPATH does not exist, you may encounter a "FileNotFoundError" when trying to open the file. You should ensure that the file exists or add error handling to address this situation.
